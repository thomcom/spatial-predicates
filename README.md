# Feature relations

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that
build up all the possible feature relations that can exist
between

    (Point, LineString)
    (Point, Polygon)
    (LineString, Polygon)
    (Polygon, Polygon)

Presently the `(Polygon, Polygon)` relation does not include holes.

In [PolygonPolygon.ipynb](./PolygonPolygon.ipynb), all of the
possible relationships between two Polygons is generated
programmatically.
